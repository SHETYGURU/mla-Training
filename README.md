## Introduction to Entity Framework Database First Approach
### What is the Database-First approach?
In Entity Framework Database First approach, the Entity Framework creates the model codes (Classes, Properties, DbContext, etc.) or you can say POCO classes from the existing database automatically. Automatically in the sense, we need to provide the necessary details about the database to the entity framework. 
```So, in simple words, we can say that the entity framework will create the model classes based on tables and columns from the relational database.```
